# EE591_Jemris_Simulations
Some JEMRIS simulations for EE591 and beyond

# How to Use
1. First, install [Jemris](https://www.jemris.org/ug_downl.html)
2. You can run the simulations in the command line with the various simu_*.xml files. You will need to change the paths for the sequence files (they are hardcoded as my user paths for right now and I can't figure out how to make it work without this, but I will update if I do).
3. The output images are best seen by opening up JEMRIS_sim (or running JEMRIS_run.m w/ the appropriate filepath to JEMRIS). You can also change the default sample used here.
